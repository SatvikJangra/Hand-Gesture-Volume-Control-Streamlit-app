Hand Gesture Controlled Volume and Music Player
This project utilizes computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control the volume and music playback on your computer. It uses the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for video processing. The hand gestures are mapped to volume control, making it an interactive and hands-free experience.
